Allows for manual edition of the segmentation afterwards\r\n\r\n## Purpose:\r\n\r\nThis package is intended to run chromosome counting routines after imaging with DAPI staining.\r\n\r\nHuman and mice chromosome counting is currently supported, but only human chromosome counting is supported through GUI.\r\n\r\nInitial spread files in .tif, .tiff, .jpg, jpeg formats are supported. Images up to 4 Mega pixels are supported. In case\r\nyou are using a jpeg image as a source, make sure it was compressed with highest quality. Because of image deformation \r\ndue to compression, the pre-processing is likely to create unlikely patterns. A good way of avoiding this is to save JPEG\r\nfiles with GIMP, while setting compression quality to 100% and smoothing to 1 in advanced parameters.\r\n\r\nThe application was tested on Windows 7 and should work on all the Windows NT (XP or better) workstations\r\n\r\n\r\n## User pipeline:\r\n\r\n1. Start the GUI by launching GUI.py\r\n\r\n2. Select the file or folder you would like to process and hit \"Preprocess\"\r\n\r\n    2.1 If a file was selected, the pre-processing will only affect this file\r\n    \r\n    2.2 If no file was selected, the pre-processing will scan through the folder and look for all the files with\r\n        allowed extension (.tif/.tiff/.jpg/.jpeg) and pre-process them all.\r\n        \r\n3. Inside the folder a \"buffer\" folder will be created, with subfolders named as selected images. In each subfolder, the\r\n    original image, segmentation mask and some program-specific data will be saved\r\n    \r\nNOTE: Depending on the OS and workstation, it might take between 1 to 5 minutes per file. The application progress bar\r\n        will not move unless a file is pre-processed, so if it looks like your process is hanging, most of the time it is\r\n        not the case.\r\n        \r\n4. Once the pre-processing will be finished, you can manually edit the segmentation mask to better fit the reality. As \r\n    a rule of thumb, all spreads that are easy to count by eye will need no additional post-processing. In case any edition\r\n    is needed, we recommend using GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP). It is free source and can be freely downloaded.\r\n    \r\n5. Once modifications are made, hit the \"Process after correction\".\r\n\r\n    5.1 A \"output\" folder will be generated in the same location as image, containing all the segmented images with \r\n    counted chromosomes\r\n    \r\n    5.2 A window will pop allowing you to inspect the segmentation results. \r\n    \r\n    5.3 If the segmentation results are unsatisfactory,\r\n        edit the corresponding mask in the corresponding buffer folder and re-save it as \"EDIT_ME2.tif\" file. \r\n\r\n    \r\n## Support:\r\n\r\nIn case of problems, please fill in the issue in the issue tracker of the master project on GitHub. We will come back to\r\nyou ASAP.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Visual:\r\n\r\nGUI:\r\n\r\n![GUI](http://i.imgur.com/VcdJF2D.png)\r\n\r\nuncorrected Spread mask\r\n\r\n![Spread Mask](http://i.imgur.com/gLC8bBE.png)\r\n\r\ncorrected Spread Mask\r\n\r\n![Spread Mask2](http://i.imgur.com/ikUJLai.png)\r\n\r\nClustering without correction\r\n\r\n![Clustering](http://i.imgur.com/wE3MxcP.png)\r\n\r\nClustering with correction\r\n\r\n![Correction](http://i.imgur.com/1cE7g6Z.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
