<p>A simple tool to count chromosomes in the metaphase spreads for mouse and human cells. Allows for manual edition of the segmentation afterwards</p>

<h2>
<a id="purpose" class="anchor" href="#purpose" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose:</h2>

<p>This package is intended to run chromosome counting routines after imaging with DAPI staining.</p>

<p>Human and mice chromosome counting is currently supported, but only human chromosome counting is supported through GUI.</p>

<p>Initial spread files in .tif, .tiff, .jpg, jpeg formats are supported. Images up to 4 Mega pixels are supported. In case
you are using a jpeg image as a source, make sure it was compressed with highest quality. Because of image deformation 
due to compression, the pre-processing is likely to create unlikely patterns. A good way of avoiding this is to save JPEG
files with GIMP, while setting compression quality to 100% and smoothing to 1 in advanced parameters.</p>

<p>The application was tested on Windows 7 and should work on all the Windows NT (XP or better) workstations</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-pipeline" class="anchor" href="#user-pipeline" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User pipeline:</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Start the GUI by launching GUI.py</p></li>
<li>
<p>Select the file or folder you would like to process and hit "Preprocess"</p>

<p>2.1 If a file was selected, the pre-processing will only affect this file</p>

<p>2.2 If no file was selected, the pre-processing will scan through the folder and look for all the files with
    allowed extension (.tif/.tiff/.jpg/.jpeg) and pre-process them all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inside the folder a "buffer" folder will be created, with subfolders named as selected images. In each subfolder, the
original image, segmentation mask and some program-specific data will be saved</p></li>
</ol>

<p>NOTE: Depending on the OS and workstation, it might take between 1 to 5 minutes per file. The application progress bar
        will not move unless a file is pre-processed, so if it looks like your process is hanging, most of the time it is
        not the case.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Once the pre-processing will be finished, you can manually edit the segmentation mask to better fit the reality. As 
a rule of thumb, all spreads that are easy to count by eye will need no additional post-processing. In case any edition
is needed, we recommend using GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP). It is free source and can be freely downloaded.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Once modifications are made, hit the "Process after correction".</p>

<p>5.1 A "output" folder will be generated in the same location as image, containing all the segmented images with 
counted chromosomes</p>

<p>5.2 A window will pop allowing you to inspect the segmentation results. </p>

<p>5.3 If the segmentation results are unsatisfactory,
    edit the corresponding mask in the corresponding buffer folder and re-save it as "EDIT_ME2.tif" file. </p>
</li>
</ol>
